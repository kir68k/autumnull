## Description
Autumnull is yet another dark palette and colorscheme, to be used with Neovim.  
The theme has been created using L\*a\*b\* values, with help of [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/), and [CIELab.io](https://cielab.io/).  
Generating a theme for Neovim in Lua has been done using [colorgen-nvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/colorgen-nvim), which I can heavily recommend.  
A TOML file is provided with color definitions, for use with colorgen-nvim.

## Plugin support?
The theme currently supports these plugins:
- [indent-blankline.nvim](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim/)
- [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/)
- [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim/)

<i>More will be added going forward</i>

## Inspiration & Name
This theme was largely inspired by the [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/vscode/) theme, my current wallpaper and love for the Autumn season, hence the "autumn" in the name.  
"-null" is a reference to `/dev/null`, or a null pointer, which I thought fit well.  
Writing the name capitalized is alright, I simply prefer plugin names to be all lowercase, or camelCase.
